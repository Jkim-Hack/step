	     <p>Hi, my name is John Kim, I am a rising sophomore (2nd year) student at The Ohio State University. I am currently studying Computer Science and Engineering, specializing systems engineering and interested in systems and mobile engineering.
	     <br>
	     <br>
	     I started programming my junior year of high school. I got into programming from being really interested in video games and I wanted to program some myself! I enrolled in a few classes and met some friends who also coded and I ended up doing a lot of mobile development. Some of my interests include competitive gaming, cooking, and going around countries to try their food!</p>
